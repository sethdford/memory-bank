# üèÑ Memory Bank + Windsurf Integration

**Enhanced AI Development with Persistent Context for Windsurf IDE**

This integration brings the powerful Memory Bank system to Windsurf IDE, providing seamless persistent context across development sessions with Cascade AI assistant that truly understands your project.

## üéØ Why Memory Bank + Windsurf?

Windsurf's Cascade AI is excellent at understanding code and context, but it lacks persistent project memory across sessions. Memory Bank solves this by:

- **Persistent Context**: Maintains project knowledge across Cascade sessions
- **Better Code Generation**: Cascade understands your patterns, architecture, and decisions
- **Consistent Standards**: Enforces coding patterns and architectural decisions
- **Automatic Documentation**: Real-time updates to project knowledge
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared context across team members using Windsurf

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Windsurf IDE** installed and running
- **Memory Bank** initialized in your project
- **Git repository** (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-windsurf.sh
```

Or manually:
1. Copy `.windsurfrules` to your project root
2. Initialize Memory Bank structure
3. Tell Cascade: "Follow the protocol in your rules"

## üîÑ Core Features

### Windsurf Rules Integration

The setup creates a comprehensive `.windsurfrules` file that:
- Instructs Cascade to always read Memory Bank files
- Provides trigger commands for Memory Bank operations
- Establishes coding standards and patterns
- Defines update procedures and workflows

### Trigger Commands

Use these commands with Cascade:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `"Follow the protocol in your rules"` | Activate Memory Bank awareness |
| `"Update Memory Bank"` or `"UMB"` | Comprehensive sync of all files |
| `"Initialize Memory Bank"` | Create Memory Bank structure |
| `"Review Memory Bank"` | Analyze and suggest improvements |

### Automatic Context Loading

When you tell Cascade to "Follow the protocol in your rules", it will:
1. Read all Memory Bank files for complete context
2. Understand current session goals
3. Reference established patterns and decisions
4. Maintain awareness throughout the session

## üí° Usage Examples

### Starting a New Session

```
Tell Cascade: "Follow the protocol in your rules. I want to add user authentication to the app."

Cascade will:
- Read all Memory Bank files
- Understand your project architecture
- Reference existing patterns
- Propose authentication approach
- Update Memory Bank with decisions
```

### During Development

```
Tell Cascade: "Create a new API endpoint for user profiles following our established patterns"

Cascade will:
- Reference systemPatterns.md for conventions
- Follow architectural decisions from decisionLog.md
- Update progress.md with completed work
- Maintain consistency with existing code
```

### End of Session

```
Tell Cascade: "Update Memory Bank with today's progress"

Cascade will:
- Update progress.md with completed work
- Document any new decisions made
- Update activeContext.md for next session
- Ensure all changes are captured
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Memory Bank Structure

```
memory-bank/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activeContext.md     # Current session state and goals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ productContext.md    # Project overview and architecture  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md          # Task tracking and milestones
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisionLog.md       # Architectural decisions with rationale
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ systemPatterns.md    # Coding patterns and Windsurf workflows
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Rules

You can extend `.windsurfrules` with project-specific instructions:

```
# Add to .windsurfrules
## Project-Specific Rules
- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow React Hooks patterns
- Include Storybook stories for UI components
- Use Jest for unit testing
```

### MCP Integration

For advanced setups, consider integrating with MCP servers:

1. **Add Memory Bank MCP Server** (if available)
2. **Configure custom tools** for Memory Bank operations
3. **Set up automated backups** of Memory Bank files

### Team Collaboration

For team usage:
1. **Commit `.windsurfrules`** to version control
2. **Share Memory Bank setup** across team members
3. **Establish Memory Bank update conventions**
4. **Use consistent trigger commands**

## üîç Best Practices

### Effective Prompting

**Instead of:**
```
Create a new component for user settings
```

**Try:**
```
Follow the protocol in your rules. Create a new user settings component following our established patterns and architectural decisions.
```

### Memory Bank Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Use "UMB" at the end of significant work sessions
2. **Clear Documentation**: Keep Memory Bank files concise and actionable
3. **Cross-References**: Link related decisions across files
4. **Timestamp Everything**: Always include timestamps for updates

### Session Management

1. **Start with Rules**: Always begin with "Follow the protocol in your rules"
2. **End with Updates**: Conclude sessions with Memory Bank updates
3. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review Memory Bank state
4. **Keep Current**: Remove outdated information

## üö¶ Troubleshooting

### Cascade Not Following Rules

1. **Explicit Reference**: Start prompts with "Follow the protocol in your rules"
2. **Check File Paths**: Ensure `.windsurfrules` exists in project root
3. **Restart Windsurf**: Reload window to refresh rules
4. **Memory Bank Files**: Verify all Memory Bank files exist

### Memory Bank Not Updating

1. **Use Trigger Commands**: Explicitly use "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB"
2. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure Memory Bank files are writable
3. **Verify Structure**: Confirm Memory Bank directory structure is correct

### Context Not Loading

1. **Initialize First**: Use "Initialize Memory Bank" if structure is missing
2. **File Content**: Ensure Memory Bank files have meaningful content
3. **Explicit Instructions**: Reference specific Memory Bank files in prompts

## üìö Integration Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

**Prompt:**
```
Follow the protocol in your rules. I need to add a shopping cart feature to our e-commerce app. Consider our existing architecture and patterns.
```

**Result:** Cascade reads Memory Bank, understands current architecture, references established patterns, proposes cart implementation, and updates Memory Bank with decisions.

### Example 2: Bug Investigation

**Prompt:**
```
Follow the protocol in your rules. There's a performance issue with our user search. Help me investigate and fix it.
```

**Result:** Cascade reviews current context, checks recent changes in progress.md, investigates issue following debugging patterns, and documents findings.

### Example 3: Code Review

**Prompt:**
```
Follow the protocol in your rules. Review this pull request against our coding standards and architectural decisions.
```

**Result:** Cascade checks systemPatterns.md and decisionLog.md, reviews code for consistency, and provides feedback aligned with project standards.
